<p>Kirkcaldy Squash Club is <strong>the</strong> place to play squash in Kirkcaldy, our two courts being host to players with skill levels from absolute beginners to experienced so-and-sos...</p>
<p>We have a number of teams, playing in Fife and Lothian leagues, and always welcome players interested in competitive squash.  If you'd rather a less serious game then you're also in luck, as we encourage friendly games between players, and run an internal ladder to encourage play.</p>

<p>if you've never played before and want to give it a try then you're in luck, as we have a number of players who can give you advice and tips to get you up and (literally) running immediately.  Plus we're running a membership promotion at the moment - &#163;30 for the remaining 8 months in the current season.  This may be even cheaper depending on your situation!  Have a look at the <a href="Joining.html">joining page</a> for more information.</p>
